        	<h1>Refund And Cancellation Policy</h1>
            <p class="policy-paragraph">
            	The Member authorizes Shoppre.com to charge his/her payment method for all services and/or account activity with Shoppre.com. Such charges may include but are not limited to membership dues, shipping and handling charges, return/reroute fees, storage charges, late charges, and any optional services. Failure to provide payment for services rendered at the time of service may result in late charges, stop shipment charges, suspension of service, cancellation of membership, and involuntary return or the discarding of any remaining merchandise.
            	<br>
				Shipping costs are based on the weight and dimensions of your shipments. Shipping costs will be charged according to the actual weight or dimensional weight, whichever is greater.
				<br>
				<br>
				Shoppre.com will allow active members to store their merchandise for up to 20 days at no charge. After 20 days, Members agree to pay storage charges per box per day, consistent with Shoppre.com's current schedule of fees.
				Prohibited or restricted merchandise is not storable and will be rejected, forfeited (and sold with the proceeds donated to charity), destroyed, or provided to government officials.
				Insurance costs for shipments of merchandise are based on the insured value. Each INR 6000 of insured value costs INR 120. The insured value is subject to the terms and conditions of the particular carrier's airway bill(s). All claims are reviewed individually and any claim payment will be based on the declared value.
				<br>
				<br>
				Claims for lost or damaged merchandise must be filed within the published time limits of the particular carrier. Claims are considered filed when a fully completed claim form, photograph(s), and supporting documentation, including receipts, are received by Shoppre.com. Claims are reviewed individually and the review process will take a minimum of eight (8) weeks. Specific commodities, including televisions, computers, electronics, jewelry, figurines, furniture and lighting have limits of liability in case of loss or damage regardless of the declared value or insurance costs paid. Any liability for damage or loss caused after delivery to Shoppre.com is limited to the lesser of either the declared value, proof of purchase price, or the specific commodity liability limit. No liability will be assumed by Shoppre.com for damage or loss caused to any items before delivery to Shoppre.com or caused to merchandise prepackaged by manufacturer. Failure to file a completed claim within the carrier time limit will invalidate the claim.
				<br>
				<br>
				Shoppre.com does not maintain its own Aircraft Accident Liability Insurance coverage.
				Either party may cancel the Membership Agreement with written notice (via email, fax, letter, or, to the extent provided by the Shoppre.com website, online). Each Member, as collateral security for the prompt and complete payment and performance when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of any amounts owed to Shoppre.com by such Member, whether under these Terms and Conditions or otherwise (the "Secured Obligations"), hereby mortgages, pledges and hypothecates to Shoppre.com and grants to Shoppre.com a lien on and security interest in, all of its right, title and interest into and under any and all packages shipped by such Member to Shoppre.com.
				<br>

				Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Shoppre.com may, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon a Member or any other person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived to the extent permitted by law), during the continuance of any account delinquency (personally or through its agents or attorneys):

                  	</li>

				<h4>Monthly membership charges (for resellers) are non-refundable.</h4>
				<br>
				 <p class="policy-paragraph">
				Each package received by Shoppre.com with an incomplete, incorrect, or old address that can be associated with a Member will be assessed a charge consistent with Shoppre.com's current schedule of fees.

				<br>
				<p class="policy-paragraph">
				The Member's Shoppre.com Locker number is to be used only for package consolidation purposes.

Failure to comply with this requirement may result in the cancellation of the Member's Shoppre.com account.
			    </p>
				<br>
				<p class="policy-paragraph">
				The Member is solely responsible for complying with any terms and conditions of sale that may be imposed by the seller of the merchandise. The Member acknowledges that Shoppre.com is not responsible for any action taken by the seller with respect to the Member's order as a result of the seller's terms and conditions of sale.
			    </p>
				<br>
				<p class="policy-paragraph">
				The Member also is responsible for informing the seller that any merchandise purchased and sent to Shoppre.com's facility ultimately will be exported out of India.
